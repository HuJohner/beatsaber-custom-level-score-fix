# beatsaber-custom-level-score-fix
This is a fix for the BeatSaber custom level scores appearing to be gone upgrading from version 1.10 to 1.11+

NOTE: Recently it seems that it changed back, so if you used this program to fix your scores you can now use the new version to reverse it. See usage for more details.

## Usage
To run the program go to [releases](https://github.com/HuJohner/beatsaber-custom-level-score-fix/releases) and download the jar. Then run the JAR by typing the following in the console
``java -jar PATH_TO_JAR``.

For reversing use ``java -jar PATH_TO_JAR -reverse``.
